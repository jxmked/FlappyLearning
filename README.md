# Flappy Learning

Recreate of [xviniette](https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning) [flappylearning](https://xviniette.github.io/FlappyLearning/) 
into TypeScript with implementation of her Machine Learning (Neuroevolution)

___An Example of implementation of [ts-neuroevolution](https://github.com/jxmked/neuroevolution-typescript) library___

## What this thing is?

"Flappy Learning" is a web-based game that uses neuroevolution machine learning to train artificial intelligence (AI) to play the 
classic game of Flappy Bird. In this game, players can watch as the AI continually improves its performance through the use of 
neuroevolution algorithms.

Neuroevolution is a form of machine learning that uses evolutionary algorithms to train neural networks. In Flappy Learning,
the AI uses neuroevolution to learn the best strategies for playing the game through trial and error. As the AI plays the
game, it receives feedback on its performance, and the algorithms adjust the neural network accordingly to improve future performance.

This game showcases the power of neuroevolution in AI training and provides a fun and interactive way to learn about the technology.
The web-based library makes it accessible and easy to use, allowing players to experience the process of training AI through neuroevolution.
